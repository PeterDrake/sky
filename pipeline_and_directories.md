# Pipeline

We assume that all of the ARM data have been downloaded and untarred. We also assume we have the corresponding .csv
files (listing shallow cumulus timestamps). All of these are in locations outside of this directory.

Our pipeline involves the following steps.

## Preprocess the Data

### What You Do

On BLT (from the `blt_job_output` directory),

```
source /bread/venv/tensorflow_gpu/bin/activate
python3 ../src/launch_preprocess.py
```

and then *after this is finished*:

```
python3 ../src/launch_allocate_timestamps.py
```

On a machine other than BLT (from the `src` directory):

```
python3 -u run_preprocess.py shcu_dubious_data.csv
python3 -u run_preprocess.py shcu_typical_data.csv
python3 -u run_allocate_timestamps.py shcu_dubious_data.csv dubious
python3 -u run_allocate_timestamps.py shcu_typical_data.csv typical
```

### What This Accomplishes

1. Clean .csv files to verify that we have photos and TSI masks for all timestamps. Write these revised .csv files.
1. Create directories for all timestamps that are listed in the two .csv files.
1. Preprocess each photo and TSI mask:
   1. The photo is centered, is cropped, and has a black border.
   1. The TSI mask has these same changes; also the sun is removed and each green pixel is replaced with the color of
   the nearest non-green pixel.
1. Subdivide timestamps into training, validation, and test sets.

## Train the Model

### What You Do

1. Set the experiment name in `config.py`. The training process won't allow
   the user to continue if the experiment name is already in `results/experiment_log.csv` or the code is not in a
   clean git state.
1. Set the network architecture name in `config.py`. The corresponding .py file in `src/model_architectures` gives the
   definition of the network architecture.
1. Build and train the network as described below.

On BLT, (from the `blt_job_output` directory):

```
source /bread/venv/tensorflow_gpu/bin/activate
python3 ../src/launch_train.py
```

(You don't need the first line, which activates the virtual environment, if it is already active.)

On a machine other than BLT (from the 'src' directory):

```
python3 -u run_train.py
```

### What This Accomplishes

1. Sets the experiment name and network architecture.
1. Build and train the network. The result is saved in a directory for the current experiment (also updating the
   experiment log).

## Process Images Using the Network

### What You Do

On BLT, (from the `blt_job_output` directory):

```
source /bread/venv/tensorflow_gpu/bin/activate
python3 ../src/launch_process.py
```

(You don't need the first line, which activates the virtual environment, if it is already active.)

On a machine other than BLT (from the 'src' directory):

```
python3 -u run_process.py
```

### What this Accomplishes

Run photos through our network to produce and save network masks.
   
## Compute Fractional Sky Coverage in Network Masks

Use network masks to create a .csv file of network FSCs.

## Produce Plots

1. Plot learning curve.
1. Analyze results (including producing plots for publication).

# Directory Structure

NOTE: On BLT, `data` and `results` are in `/bread/proj/drake_kleiss_sky`.
